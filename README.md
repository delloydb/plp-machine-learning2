# 🌍 AI for Climate Action: Carbon Emissions Forecasting using Regression
✅ 1. SDG and Problem Definition
SDG 13 – Climate Action

# Problem:
As countries strive to meet climate targets under agreements like the Paris Accord, accurately forecasting carbon emissions is critical for creating effective policies. However, many developing nations lack real-time tools for projecting their emissions based on energy use, industrial output, and population growth.

# 🎯 Goal
Build a supervised machine learning model that uses historical environmental and socioeconomic indicators to predict future carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions (in metric tons per capita or total annual emissions per country).

# 📊 2. Dataset Sources
World Bank Open Data
UN SDG Indicators Database
Global Carbon Atlas
Kaggle Datasets (e.g., "CO₂ Emissions by Country")
Sample Features:
Year
Country
Population
GDP per capita
Energy consumption (kWh/capita)
Fossil fuel % of energy use
Renewable energy share
Industrial output
Forest area (% of land)
Urbanization rate
Target:
CO₂ emissions (metric tons per capita or total)

# 🧠 3. Machine Learning Approach
Type: Supervised Learning
Task: Regression
Algorithm Options:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor (e.g., XGBoost)
LSTM/GRU (for temporal patterns, advanced stage)

# 🛠 4. Workflow Overview
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values
Normalize/scale features
One-hot encode categorical variables (e.g., countries or regions)
Feature engineering (e.g., emission per GDP unit)

Step 2: Model Training
Use regression models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting
Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV

Step 3: Evaluation
Metrics: MAE, RMSE, R²
Visualization:
Line plot: Actual vs Predicted CO₂ over time
Feature importance chart
Emissions heatmap by region
Step 4: Forecasting
Allow projections for future years (e.g., 2025–2030) based on simulated input trends.

# 📈 5. Tools & Libraries
Python
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
XGBoost or LightGBM (optional)
Plotly for interactive graphs

# 🧪 6. Ethical & Social Reflection
Bias & Fairness: Ensure data includes both developed and developing countries to avoid geographical bias.
Transparency: Clearly explain model assumptions to avoid misinterpretation of future projections.
Usefulness: Helps governments simulate scenarios like increasing renewables or cutting fossil fuel subsidies.
Sustainability: Encourages data-backed climate policies and emission reduction strategies.

# 🔚 Conclusion
This project leverages supervised learning to forecast CO₂ emissions, giving policymakers a predictive lens into how today's decisions impact tomorrow’s climate. With accurate forecasting tools, we can plan smarter and move closer to the net-zero future we need.
